### Date created
The Bikeshare project was created on 16/09/2021

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Project Overview:
This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform a rudimentary analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

Running the program:
I used the setup process on udacity learning classroom to set up my git bash which helped me a lot when running and debugging my bikeshare.py script.  I use Anaconda's command prompt on a windows 8.1 to activate conda on my machine..
Program Details:

The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (10 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

    Most popular month
    Most popular day
    Most popular hour


    Most popular start station
    Most popular end station
    Most popular combination of start and end stations


    Total trip duration
    Average trip duration


    Types of users by number
    Types of users by gender (if available)
    The oldest user (if available)
    The youngest user (if available)
    The most common birth year amongst users

    (if available)

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.

Assistance Used to complete the project

1. https://www.giters.com/xhlow/udacity-bikeshare-project?amp=1...It helped me to write properly some pandas methods.
2.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Ncob63BLo Code: https://youtu.be/5Fl5MPaFrH4. This youtube video equally helped me alot when debugging while my code was failing. Especially when it keeps writing <bound method pandas delegate._add_delegate_acc..
3. Python library documentation.
